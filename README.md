Convertible bonds represent a unique financial instrument, combining the features
of traditional debt and equity. This thesis delves into the application of binomial tree
models for pricing convertible bonds, with a focus on the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR)
framework and its enhancements, including the drift-adjusted CRR model and alternative
approaches such as Tian, Jarrow-Rudd, and Haahtela models.
The research begins by examining the structural features of convertible bonds and
their market drivers. It follows a detailed implementation of the CRR model, showing its
capability to handle key characteristics of convertible bonds, such as early conversion
and sensitivity to market variables. The drift-adjusted CRR model refines the framework
by incorporating specific growth dynamics, making it suitable for non-standard market
scenarios.
Then I explore the alternative binomial tree models, each addressing limitations 
of the standard CRR. The Tian model incorporates skewness for asymmetric distributions,
the Jarrow-Rudd model adjusts for symmetry, and the Haahtela model
extends flexibility beyond lognormal assumptions. These models are evaluated through
numerical analysis and comparative studies, emphasizing their convergence properties
and sensitivity to key parameters.
A significant contribution of this work is the validation of these models through
Taylor approximations and the computation of Greeks, which measure the sensitivity of
bond prices to market variables. This approach ensures the reliability of the numerical
frameworks and highlights their practical applications.
